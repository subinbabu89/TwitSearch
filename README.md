# TwitSearch
Takes a keyword and shows list of posts which are returned from the twitter search API

Uses the Twitter SearchService which is a part of the TwitterApiClient.

Does not handle errors from the twitter api based on invalid input, overdraw limits, etc. Instead it shows a generic message asking the user to use a different search term
